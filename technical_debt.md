# Technical debt
Use this file to track the tech debt that is too small to go into a ticket. Please prefix each task/issue with your initials. Delete any tasks/issues that have been completed, don't feel the need to re-order the numbers.

e.g.

`1. AF: Add print stylesheet`

Low priority [LP]
Nice to have: [NTH]
