# Components

This is the components folder for the Clarity toolkit. Each component will be compiled using Gulp so only edit component files within this folder.

Each folder has the following structure:

view.vue (The HTML code and javascript for the component)
style.styl (The stylesheet for the component (written using Stylus)
component.json (The documentation for the component)

it may also have the following optional files/folders:

images/ (any component-specific images)
store.js (The data store for the component)

There can also be variations of the stylesheets for internet explorer and prints, e.g. style.ie.styl and style.print.styl
